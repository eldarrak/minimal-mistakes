title: Solar geolocation forum @ornithologyexchange

Just discovered that web forum for solar geolocation is available now at [ornithologyexchange](http://ornithologyexchange.org/forums/forum/259-geolocator-discussion-support/).iIt even already has one post. Ask there if you need help with the FLightR _per se_ on with solar geolocation in general.
